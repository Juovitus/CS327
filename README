int CheckBoundsValid(int x, int xMax)
	Checks if x is valid, should probably have a lower bound

static int32_t Path_Compare(const void *key, const void *with)
    IDK the instructor gave us this, it compares costs

int32_t Dijkstra_Path(mapGrid *map, struct Point from, struct Point to, uint32_t characterType)
    Does Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue on my map for different player types

void GenerateCostMap(uint32_t characterType)
    Generates the cost map of the given character type

void PrintCostMap(uint32_t characterType)
    Prints the cost map of the given character type

void PlacePlayerCharacter(int currX, int currY)
    Places player at a random spot given the location of the current map

void DisplayMap(mapGrid *map)
    	Literally displays the map given to it

void GenerateMap()
	Generates the entire map(for starts)
	It generates the border, randomly generates the openings on the cardinal
	borders, fills the map with clearings, pathfinds between the openings,
	randomly places pokecenter and pokemart and randomly places two grass clearings.
	^Changed to generate maps in a 2d array only when visited

void GetUserInput()
	This class gets user input and evaluates it.

int main()
	This class is the main method of the project and simply calls GenerateMap()
